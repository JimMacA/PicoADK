Permanent location will be on a Harvard-maintained site, probably.

Hardware:
The baseboard is GrovePicoADK, a simple platform for a PicoADK that allows for mounting on a Eurorack, and brings out Grove connectors.

GroveHeadphoneAmp runs the line out from the PicoADK through a volume control, then into a headphone amp, and out a TRS connector.
It also sends the unbuffered line signal to another TRS connector.

GrovePots is a pair of potentiometers which can be connected to PicoADK's analog inputs through a Grove connector.

GroveMIDIINTrs is a TRS MIDI input adapter board.
